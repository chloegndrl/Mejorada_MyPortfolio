        <h2><font color="gray">ABOUT ME</font></h2>
        <p>
            Hi! Welcome to my page. Well if I would describe myself, I really don't know who I am but I guess we all do at some point. 
            Kidding but not, I still want to let you know about me. I'm an ambivert. Everybody always think of me as the type of person 
            who is hard to read. I love to eat, read, play and I'm being honest, not the kind of person who loves to study but when it 
            comes to sports especially Badminton, I would put and leave everything down because it is my life and I love it so much. 
            I am an athlete in TUP and in the sport I've mentioned. Aside from that, I am a chill person but most things scare me like extreme rides. 
            Working out calms me down and helps me think. Also, I really do not put my energy and time to things that doesn't matter especially, 
            the things that won't help me grow. My peace and well-being are my top priority and is a very important aspect of life for me. 
            Above all, I put God and my family first.
        </p>

        <h2><font color="gray">Background in Programming</font></h2>
        <p>
            I don't have any background and my programming experience hasn't been easy since this is not the course I planned to take before. 
                        I really did not expect that this is the course that I will be in because computers, programming, 
                        and creating systems, are really not what I am  interested in.  There are a lot of struggles that 
                        I have to face in this course. Full of doubts and cries because I don't know if I'll make it. 
                        Even though I managed to understand some things and how it works, creating codes with just 
                        instructions is really really hard for me. I find it very challenging and my frustration and
                        anxiety gets worse everytime. Fortunately, there are good friends that I can always ask 
                        and also google for help and I am glad that they are always helping me because they see that 
                        I really struggle. Google also helps me a lot. I really wouldn't have made it to 3rd year 
                        without any help. There are instructions and explanations but still, it is really hard for me 
                        to understand on my own. Despite all, I am still willing to learn even if it takes time.
